These are the Stata files associated with the paper "Partial Identification of the Dark Figure of Crime with Survey Data under Misreporting Errors".
The paper is currently "revise and resubmit" at the Journal of Quantitative Criminology.

This will work with the Crime Survey for England and Wales, as dowloaded from the U.K. Data Archive.
Users only need to change the directories to the location where they have saved the data. 
The outputs are assumed to be saved in a folder ("outputs") within the one where these files are stored.
